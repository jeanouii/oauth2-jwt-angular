# Microprofile JWT Movie Chat

This web application shows how to use Microprofile JWT to secure your microservices.
It uses Apache TomEE as the default Microprofile implementation.

# OAuth2 + JWT (STS)

In order to work, this application requires an STS capable of generating signed JWT tokens.
We use Tribestream API Gateway as it's a complete Security Token Service.
It's also capable of doing routing and while enforcing permissions.
If you want to know more, check out the website at https://tribestream.io

To start the Tribestream API Gateway on a terminal execute the following command:

    mvn tag:run

The following message indicates the Tribestream API Gateway is up and running:

    [INFO] Tribestream started http://localhost:8080/tag/

You can login now using on a browser the following URL: http://localhost:8080/tag/ using `admin` for both the username and password.

# Start the movie chat application

On a new terminal execute the following command:


    mvn clean install -DskipTests tomee:run

The following message indicates the application is up and running:

You can login now using on a browser the following URL: http://localhost:8080/movies

You can test any of the following accounts:
- Account `alex` with password `password` with create, update and delete role.
- Account `john` with password `password` with just comments add role.

# Angular Http Interceptors

## Simple Example
For your project to sign a request you might need only one interceptor or header inject.
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthHeaderInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  constructor(private $auth: AuthService) { }
  intercept(req: RetryHttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle(req.clone({
      headers:
        req.headers.set(this.$auth.authHeader,
          `${this.$auth.authPrefix} ${this.$auth.authToken}`)
    }));
  }
}
```

## Usage
For this example we added three interceptors that are injected into angular 8 project into root module providers.

```
import { HeaderInterceptors } from './services/header.interceptor';

...typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ...
  ],
  imports: [
    ...
  ],
  providers: [
    ...
    HeaderInterceptors
  ],
  bootstrap: [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

# Our usage

First interceptor https://github.com/tomitribe/oauth2-jwt-angular/blob/master/src/main/angular-app/src/app/services/header.interceptor.ts#L13[NoAuthHeaderInterceptor] adds Authorization header to a request.

Second interceptor https://github.com/tomitribe/oauth2-jwt-angular/blob/master/src/main/angular-app/src/app/services/header.interceptor.ts#L27[OauthHeaderInterceptor] adds `$$noAuth` property to a request for any request that should not be signed/authorised.

Third interceptor https://github.com/tomitribe/oauth2-jwt-angular/blob/master/src/main/angular-app/src/app/services/header.interceptor.ts#L46[RetryHeaderInterceptor] checks for 401 errors and handles refresh/retry of request.

Also check interceptors https://github.com/tomitribe/oauth2-jwt-angular/blob/master/src/main/angular-app/src/app/services/header.interceptor.ts[source] and https://github.com/tomitribe/oauth2-jwt-angular/blob/master/src/main/angular-app/src/app/app.module.ts#L52[usage];
